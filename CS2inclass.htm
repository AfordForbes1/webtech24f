    <h2 id="#AA"><!--add id--> About Amber</h2>
    <p>Hi, my name is Amber. I’m an 18-year-old Belizean-American, first-generation college student, and entrepreneur. I’m currently a senior majoring in Technology Entrepreneurship, living in NYC with roots tracing back to Belize. I'm also a proud dog mom of two adorable Shih Tzus, one boy and one girl. A fun fact about me is that I spent three years in premed school during high school, which was quite an experience, but ultimately, I found my passion in business. This led me to start my own <a href="https://Styledbyrosebooking.as.me/" target="_blank"> business</a> specializing in protective hairstyles, including but not limited to wig installs, braids, and loc retwists. My journey as an entrepreneur has been fueled by my passion for striving, growing, and persevering.</p>

    <h2 id="#AH">Amber's Hobbies </h2>	
<p>I consider myself to be very creative and goal-oriented. I’ve been a hairstylist for seven years and brought my services to campus during my first year, continuously growing and developing my brand ever since. Although hairstyling takes up most of my free time, I also enjoy cooking and painting. There’s something so satisfying about creating a delicious meal from scratch, and painting allows my creativity to shine through. Passion is energy, and it sparks determination—qualities that have been the driving force behind my success and dedication to providing excellent services to my clientele since 2018.
